This is a svelte project containing solutions to multiple problems on [front end mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

Every route is a solution to one problem. 

I am using <strong>Tailwindcss</strong> for the styling  and <strong>libsql</strong> and 
<strong>drizzle</strong> for the fullstack problem, it is probably a little overkill but i know them so why not.

I have another big exercise (space-tourism) in another repo, i probably should place them all in one place, but that is for another time.
